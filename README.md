# Apple2-IO-RPi
Apple II expansion card using a Raspberry Pi for I/O

## Project Status
This is a very early stage project. Currently one partially completed physical prototype exists that sends data unidirectional from the Raspberry Pi Zero W to the Apple II via 8 bit parallel data bus.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide I/O for an Apple II series 8 bit computer via a Raspberry Pi Zero W which is powered by the Apple II expansion bus.

## Similar Project
If you're looking for complete hardware design or prefer having Apple II peripherals control a control a Raspberry Pi rather than simply using the Raspberry Pi to provide storage and network access to the Apple II, have a look at David Schmenk's excellent [Apple2Pi](https://github.com/dschmenk/apple2pi) project.
